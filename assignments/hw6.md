# Function Practice

Create your own examples of the following:

1. Create a function expression. In other words, a function that gets assigned to a variable. _(1 pt.)_
2. Create a function that uses a `return` statement. Call the function and assign whatever gets `return`ed to a variable. `console.log()` that result. _(2 pts.)_
3. Create a function that accepts a *callback function.* (_2 pts.)_

*1 pt. EC*: Create a function that `return`s another function.

You should find all of these types of examples in the videos and in some Fiddles. See the assignment post in Slack. *Make them your own.*

Also, the best way to do your `commit`s on this assignment is probably to break it up into at least 3-4 `commit`s. And you can simply copy/paste part from the directions above to make a nice `commit` message. 

For example, after finishing the first part for 1 point, I might do: `git commit -m "Create a fxn. expression."`
